# Linear-Regression-Implementation
Implementation of simple and multiple linear regression analysis

This was a program I wrote as part of my junior project (high school). I chose to learn more about the implementation of linear regression
because I was interested in exploring the field of machine learning but did not have any prior experience. I first researched the math 
behind simple linear regression, then used this knowledge to implement it from scratch. I compared my implementation with the linear
regression model from scikit-learn to verify its accuracy. I then repeated the process for multiple linear regression with two variables, again implementing it from scratch.
